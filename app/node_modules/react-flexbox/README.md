# React-flexbox

Implementation of css flexbox in react with inline styles.
It is written in ES6 and requires an ES6 to ES5 transpiler. If there is need for
it I can add a transpiled version to the repo.

## Components

### View

A flex view element that can be used instead of `FlexRow` or `FlexColumn`

This is default import.

Some simple examples:

```js
<View row>
  <View auto row>
    <View column width="100px"><View className="red">Left</View></View>
    <View column width="100px"><View className="red">Left</View></View>
  </View>
  <View row className="green">All the place in the world</View>
</View>
```

```js
<View column height="200px">
  <View column auto>
    <View className="green" height="20px">Green</View>
    <View className="red" height="20px">Red</View>
  </View>
  <View className="green">De rest</View>
</View>
```

### Props

All props are optional and can be set on both components.

#### row

boolean, sets the flexDirection to row

#### auto

boolean, sets flex to '0 0 auto'

#### className

#### height

_height_ must be a string with a valid css unit.

#### style

Will be merged the flex style. This allows you to override the style.

#### width

_width_ can be either a number `width={2}`, this acts as _flex-grow_ or a string
with a unit (for example _%_ or _px_) - it must be a valid css unit.
