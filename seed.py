This process improves investment manageability, lowers risk of project failure, shortens the time to realize value, and allows agencies to better adapt to changing needs.\n\nCONTRACTING OFFICER (CO): The Government official responsible for the execution and administration of contracts on behalf of the Government.\n\nCONTRACTING OFFICER’S REPRESENTATIVE (COR): An individual designated by the Contracting Officer to act as his/her representative to assist in managing the contract. The authorities and limitations of a COR appointment are contained in the written letter of appointment.\n\nDAY: A calendar day unless stated otherwise. If a deliverable is due on a weekend or holiday, the deliverable shall be considered due the next business day.\n\nQUARTER: A quarter will be defined as the first of January through the end of March, first of April through the end of June, first of July through the end of September, and first of October through the end of December.\n\nBUSINESS DAY: Any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday, a Federal holiday or other day on which the Federal Government by law or executive order is closed.

Each iteration is small in scale (i.e., encompasses a single or a few function(s) within a multistep process). Multiple iterations form releases. For more information, see the TechFAR at https://github.com/WhiteHouse/playbook/blob/gh-pages/_includes/techfar-online.md\n\nMILESTONES/EPICS:A necessary step in a process. In this document, used to refer to components of a given project.\n\nSTORY POINT:A measurement of work and effort. Story points are used in an Agile development environment to demonstrate how much work was achieved in a given sprint or iteration.
